  <p class="text">Welcome to my blog!</p>
  
  <p class="text">I'm François Le Nôtre - a software test analyst currently based in Lyon area, France. </br></br>
  I have been involved in testing for over six years now, testing a wide range of interfaces in different sectors 
  and technical environments. Over the last years I specialized in mobile websites, native applications, data 
  and web services manual testing. I also have a passion for exploratory testing. </br></br>
  <!--I am a firm believer that exploratory testing is an extremely efficient and complementary test methodology 
  that can bring a lot to the software delivery speed in a team; It unleashes the tester's responsability and 
  creativity, which makes of him a even stronger valuable asset.</br></br>-->
  I really enjoy sharing knowledge, which is why I contributed to software testing conferences previously, such 
  as the Eurostar one; I regularly attend IT Meetup events, online webinars, read books and blogs about testing,
  constantly seeking for learning and inspiration. </br></br>
  Starting to write articles about my own experience is just another way of sharing my own knowledge; I would love 
  to hear any feedback you have or to exchange with you on any topic or questions you have. Feel free to contact me 
  via the links in the footer: Twitter, email, Viadeo and LinkedIn, where you can also view my achievements.
